                        <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city then in the erstwhile British
                            Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a
                            Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin.[14][15][2][5][16] His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a
                            schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a
                            housewife with a very religious mindset.[17] His older siblings, along with other family
                            members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, who would often
                            write to Khan's parents about the new life they had found in Pakistan.[18]

                            After his matriculation from a local school in Bhopal, in 1952 Khan emigrated from India to
                            Pakistan on the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation politics[19]: 254  at that
                            time, and religious violence in India during his youth had left an indelible impression on
                            his world view.[20] Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly attended the D.
                            J. Science College before transferring to the University of Karachi, where he graduated in
                            1956 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration on solid-state
                            physics.[21][22]
